I had an idea for a building for the Serpentine Pavilion in London and built it out of toothpicks and cardboard. 
I tried to model it in Onshape but it didn't really work but here's the link to the Onshape: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/907793d167cc283e46aaebeb/w/fb92e40b25206e3220ed727f/e/2e58fc6c4ad3fe633bc4279b?renderMode=0&uiState=66a7f5fda57dd41ba93b7eed
